            Savitribai Phule was one of the pioneer Indian female teacher of
            Modern education system established in Bombay Presidency area of
            British India (present-day Western Maharashtra, India), Indian
            social reformer, educationalist, and poet from Maharashtra. Along
            with her husband, Jyotiba Phule she started a girl school at Pune in
            Maharashtra . She played a vital role in improving women's rights in
            India. She is considered to be the pioneer of India's feminist
            movement. Savitribai and Jyotiba together founded one of the early
            modern Indian girls' school in Pune, at Bhidewada in 1848. She
            strived to abolish discrimination and unfair treatment of people on
            the basis of caste and gender. However, In the 19th century,
            Christian missionaries founded some school for girls in India such
            as Robert May of the London Missionary Society, who was the first
            person to open a school exclusively for girls[5] in the region of
            Chinsurah, Bengal, in 1818. American Christian missionaries
            established some schools in Bombay, Ahemadnagar. The latter girl's
            schools inspired Jyotiba Phule to establish a girl's school in
            Poona. She attended the Normal school in Poona and American
            christian missionary Cynthia Farrar's school in Ahmednagar where she
            attended the course for teachers training<br /><br />
           

          <strong><u>Career</u></strong><br />

           After completing her teacher's education, Savitribai Phule
          started teaching girls at Poona. She did so alongside Sagunabai
          Kshirsagar, sister of Jyotiba Phule[2] who was a revolutionary
          feminist as well as a mentor to Jyotirao.[citation needed] Not long
          after beginning to teach with Sagunabai, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule
          along with Sagunabai started their own school at Bhide-wada. Bhidewada
          was the home of Tatya Saheb Bhide, who was inspired by the work that
          the trio was doing. The curriculum at Bhidewada included traditional
          western curriculum of mathematics, science, and social studies.<br/><br/> 
          By the end of 1851, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule were running three
          different schools for girls in Pune. Combined, the three schools had
          approximately one hundred and fifty students enrolled. Like the
          curriculum, the teaching methods employed by the three schools
          differed from those used in government schools. The author Divya
          Kandukuri believes that the Phule methods were regarded as being
          superior to those used by government schools. As a result of this
          reputation, the number of girls receiving their education at the
          Phule's schools outnumbered the number of boys enrolled in government
          schools.[8]<br/><br/> 
           Unfortunately, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule's success
          came with much resistance from the local community with conservative
          views. Kandukuri states that Savitribai often travelled to her school
          carrying an extra sari because she would be assailed by her
          conservative opposition with stones, dung, and verbal abuse.
          Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule were living at Jyotirao's father's home.
          However, in 1839, Jyotirao's father asked him to abandon this work or
          leave his home because orthodox people around him threatened to
          boycott him from the community or by author Divya Kandukari <br/><br/> 
          
          After moving out of Jyotirao's father's home, the Phule's moved in
          with the family of one of Jyotirao's friends, Usman Sheikh. It was
          there that Savitribai met a soon to be close friend and colleague
          named Fatima Begum Sheikh. According to Nasreen Sayyed, a leading
          scholar on Sheikh, "Fatima Sheikh knew how to read and write already,
          her brother Usman who was a friend of Jyotiba, had encouraged Fatima
          to take up the teacher training course. She went along with Savitribai
          to the Normal School and they both graduated together. She was the
          first Muslim woman teacher of India". Fatima and Savitribai opened a
          school in Sheikh's home in 1849.[8] <br/><br/> 
          In the 1850s, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule established two educational trusts. They were entitled:
          the Native Male School, Pune and the Society for Promoting the
          Education of Mahars, Mangs, and Etceteras. These two trusts ended up
          encompassing many schools which were led by Savitribai Phule and
          later, Fatima Sheikh.[8] Jyotirao summarises Savitribai and his work
          in an interview given to the Christian missionary periodical,
          Dnyanodaya, on 15 September 1853, saying, It did occur to me that the
          improvement that comes about in a child due to the mother is very
          important and good. So those who are concerned with the happiness and
          welfare of this country should definitely pay attention to the
          condition of women and make every effort to impart knowledge to them
          if they want the country to progress. With this thought, I started the
          school for girls first. But my caste brethren did not like that I was
          educating girls and my own father threw us out of the house. Nobody
          was ready to give space for the school nor did we have money to build
          it. People were not willing to send their children to school but
          Lahuji Ragh Raut Mang and Ranba Mahar convinced their caste brethren
          about the benefits of getting educated.[7] <br/><br/> 
          Together with her husband she taught children from different castes and had opened a total of 18
          schools.[16] The couple also opened a care centre called Balhatya
          Pratibandhak Griha[12] (transl.â€‰Centre to stop child killing) for
          pregnant rape victims and helped deliver and save their children.
